This document focus on the changes that has been made in the application and the reason behind this.
We can't do descriptive comments inside the code. That looks bad. And that is why this plain text document is necessary. 
If any developer fail to understand the reason behind any change, s/he will at first look in to the code for the change explanation. If the code does not hold 
sufficient explanation then s/he will try to find the explanation in this document.

Note: Although it's an old approach to write down the changes in a document. In this case I believe that this will help us(the developer of the project).

Change : The project now included zozo.accordion.js instead of zozo.accordion.min.js
Reason :  I found that when I have putted rememberState:true in the accordion setting option object, expandModes.multiple default enable by the API.
          After looking in to the code I found that line number 685 of zozo.accordion.js read the local store information as an Array and then make the expandMode
          multiple. Which is wrong. Wo I just commented the line and using the zozo.accordion.js file instead of zozo.accordion.min.js file.

Pending Task : When the project will be done. We will convert this zozo.accordion.js to zozo.accordion.min.js  and include that updated file in the project.

Change : jquery.autocomplete.js => at line number 198 I have disabled the feature onfocus
Reason : Suppose a user has typed a customer id and selected it and then the corresponding customer information fetched from database.
         Now if I place the cursur in the autocomplete textbox it again search for the customer info. Which means onfocus actually 
         call the onselect method internally. We don't need that feature.
         
         We have actually used the custom autocomplete from this location -
         https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete
         
         Not the standard jquery autocomplete.

Pending Task : No pending task.

Developer : Ifti
Change : Changes customer_id to comm_customer_id
Reason : In many interfaces we need to show the customer basic information like Customer ID,Customer Type,Region/Area,Category,Customer Name,F/H Name and Address.
         So we have shifted this basic information form to a new jsp file named CustomerInfo.jsp.
         
         And also added a prefix "comm_" for all the field id. So that it can't create any conflict with other fields 
         of the mother interface.
         
         Updated Method : setCustomerInfo(field_prefix,data)
		 
		 For setting the customer information we have added a prefix parameter in setCustomerInfo Table         

Pending Task : Need to find out the reference of old setCustomerInfo method and fix it with the new implementation.
